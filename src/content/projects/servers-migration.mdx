Bible Vector Search is a tool I built for myself, I had this idea for quite a while to use the AI and Vector DB technology to build some tools for the Christian community.

This tool is to allow users to search Bible verses by meaning, not just by keywords, the output is similar to Google Search, since Google has basically innovated their search engine to index the whole Internet, and the Internet probably covers majority of QA about Bible verses.

However, they are not the same.

1. This solution is much greener, because it does not need a huge data centre to index the whole Internet, it only needs a small vector DB to index the Bible verses, and the AI NLT model to understand the meaning of the verses.

2.It is open source and privacy friendly, no aggressive tracking and no ads.
