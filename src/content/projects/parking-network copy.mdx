Design and implementation of a complete network infrastructure for a parking facility, integrating over 30 devices including switches, routers, Wi-Fi access points, and a firewall.

The project combined Ethernet and fiber optic cabling, implemented VLANs for segmentation and security, deployed VPNs for secure remote access, and configured a firewall to protect internal resources. In addition, the entire infrastructure was monitored with Zabbix, ensuring availability, performance, and proactive issue detection.

The final solution delivered a robust, scalable, and secure high-performance network to support control systems, video surveillance, and high-density wireless connectivity.
